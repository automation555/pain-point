To get Pain Point running, run:
  sudo gem install geminstaller
  sudo geminstaller
  rake db:create:all
  rake db:migrate
  rake spec:db:fixtures:load
  script/server

To run the tests:
  selenium
  script/screw_unit_server
  rake

Some minimum features of pain-point:

1) allow users to signup
2) allow users to create pain points
3) allow users to edit paint points
4) allow users to vote on a pain point

To use Selenium, you will need to have firefox-bin (firefox 2) on your path and set the environment variable MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1
