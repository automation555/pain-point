=== 0.1.25 / 2008-02-26

* nbsp method
* :class => ['one', 'two']  (that is, passing an array rather than a string)
... perhaps one or two I forgot.
* rename tag to element
* add empty_element feature
* for the built-in HTML tags, knows which ones should be empty and which shouldn't be.
  For example, generates `<input />` rather than `<input></input>`
* text and attributes are quoted by default; call raw to avoid this
* h is rarely necessary now, but it returns a string rather than appending to the buffer
* nbsp method turns spaces into non-breaking spaces
* sending in an array for attribute values (typically CSS classes) concatenates them separated by spaces
* The column definition name can be a Proc that gets executed.
* Renamed instruct! to instruct (old one remains as a deprecated method for now), as it is no more side-effecting (or dangerous or whatever) than any other method in Widget.
