Thank you for signing up for the Developer Testing Tricks talk. This talk is going to be highly interactive. There will be an hour worth of pair programming with your fellow attendees.

To make this possible at least 1/2 of you will need to bring your laptop. I highly recommend you bringing your laptop, with the correct software loaded. Please do this from home, as the internet bandwidth at the conference may not be very good.

The application that will be used in the talk is named Pain Point. It's a simple application that allows its users to write what their pain points are and to vote on other members' pain points.

You can get access to the current state of Pain Point at http://github.com/btakita/pain-point
If you havn't used Git before, it is a great tool to check out. Once you have Git installed, you can clone Pain Point by running `git clone git://github.com/btakita/pain-point.git`.

There a number of interesting technologies in Pain Point including:
* Rails (of course)
* rspec (http://rspec.info)
* Screw Unit javascript behavioral test framework (http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit)
* RR double framework (http://github.com/btakita/rr & http://pivots.pivotallabs.com/users/brian/blog/articles/352-introducing-rr)
* Selenium (http://openqa.org)
* Polonium (http://github.com/pivotal/polonium)
* Fitnesse (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitNesse)
* Client server programming using advanced Javascript
* And more...

Pain Point may use several gems that you don't currently have on your machine. To install then run:
  git clone git://github.com/btakita/pain-point.git
  cd pain-point
  sudo gem install geminstaller
  sudo geminstaller

Please click the follow link at http://github.com/btakita/pain-point to receive updates to the application.

If you have problems running geminstaller, you can look inside geminstaller.yml to see what the gem dependencies are.

I have also enclosed my notes when coming up with the talk. Its mainly reference material that you may find useful during or after the tutorial.
