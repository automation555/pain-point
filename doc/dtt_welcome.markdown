Thank you for signing up for the Developer Testing Tricks talk.
This talk will be highly interactive, and there will be an hour of pair programming with your fellow attendees.
To make this possible, at least half of the attendees will need to bring a laptop.

Pain Point is a sample application developed for this tutorial.
Pain Point tracks problems that impede workflow. It allows users to read, write, and vote for their particular pain points.

I highly recommend bringing a laptop with Pain Point and its dependencies loaded.
The internet connection may be slow at the conference, so please do this before you come.

The Pain Point source is at [http://github.com/btakita/pain-point](http://github.com/btakita/pain-point)
You can clone Pain Point by running `git clone git://github.com/btakita/pain-point.git`

Pain Point uses a number of interesting technologies including:

-   rspec [http://rspec.info](http://rspec.info)
-   Screw Unit javascript behavioral test framework [http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit](http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit)
-   RR double framework [http://github.com/btakita/rr](http://github.com/btakita/rr) & [http://pivots.pivotallabs.com/users/brian/blog/articles/352-introducing-rr](http://pivots.pivotallabs.com/users/brian/blog/articles/352-introducing-rr)
-   Selenium [http://openqa.org](http://openqa.org)
-   Polonium [http://github.com/pivotal/polonium](http://github.com/pivotal/polonium)
-   Fitnesse [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitNesse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitNesse)
-   Client server programming using advanced Javascript
-   And more...

Pain Point uses several gems that you may not have on your machine. To install them run:

      git clone git://github.com/btakita/pain-point.git
      cd pain-point
      gem install geminstaller
      geminstaller

You can "watch" Pain Point by getting a Github account and going to [http://github.com/btakita/pain-point/toggle_watch](http://github.com/btakita/pain-point/toggle_watch).
This will automatically sign you up to receive updates to pull the latest revisions.

If you have problems running geminstaller, you can look inside geminstaller.yml for a list of the gem dependencies needed to run Pain Point.
